  I'm a Ph.D student major in computer science and engineering at the Ohio State University. I'm fortunate to work with
  Professor [Deliang Wang](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dwang/) in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/). 
  I received my bachelor degree from Southeast University and master degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
  
  I'm interested in speech and music processing, focusing on using deep learning to address tasks such as audio separation, acoustic echo cancellation, howling suppression, multi-pitch tracking, etc.
