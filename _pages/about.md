  I'm a Ph.D student major in computer science and engineering at the Ohio State University. I'm fortunate to work with
  Professor [Deliang Wang](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dwang/) in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/). 
  I received my bachelor degree from Southeast University and master degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
  
  I specialize in speech and music processing, focusing on utilizing deep learning techniques to tackle challenges such as audio separation, acoustic echo cancellation, howling suppression, and multi-pitch tracking.
