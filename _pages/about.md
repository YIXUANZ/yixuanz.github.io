  I'm a Ph.D student major in computer science and engineering at the Ohio State University, advised by Professor [Deliang Wang](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dwang/) in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/). I received my bachelor degree from Southeast University and master degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
  
  I'm interested in music source separation, speech separation, pitch tracking, digital signal processing and deep learning.
